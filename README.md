# Image Filtering
The goal of this task is to experiment with image filtering, and get familiarized with tricks, e.g., padding,
commonly used by computer vision practitioners. Specifically, the task is to perform image smoothing and
image sharpening using a low-pass filter and a high-pass filter shown in Table 1 for the given image.

# Template Matching
The goal of this task is to experiment with template matching algorithms, i.e., normalized cross correlation
(NCC). Specifically, the task is to locate a given image patch in a large image.
